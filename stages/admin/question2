While working on a [project]( https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/163675/simon-in-javascript)
I had to delay the execution of player input (in the ```fail()``` function of the project).
I tried to accomplish this with ```setTimeout(playGame(), 2000)``` . 
This did not work but using ```setTimeout(function(){playGame()}, 2000)``` did.
I am not clear why there had to be an additonal function statement within the ```setTimeout```. 

Based on reading the [MDN discussion of ```setTimeout```](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout)
I take it this is a scope issue?  Is that correct? Any insight or explanation would be appreciated.  Thank you.
