I am new to working with React and as an exercise have tried to modify the clock example
from React's splash page.  The goal is to have the seconds count at one interval and change 
circle's color at a more rapid interval.  

I have tried to do this by using ```setTimeout``` functions for the changes to the circle
and called them from within the ```tick``` function but the ```setTimeout``` calls are not being 
recognized.  

Is this an issue with React and the ```setInterval``` conflicting with the ```setTimeout```?
If so what is the best way to achieve offset timed events? 

Thank you for your time.
